## Introduction
Every person looks at the weather or makes note of the weather before going outside, what if we could predict the weather without having to look at the news or other such sources.

This project aims to examine historical weather data from JFK International Airport in NY, USA to predict the weather of tomorrow.
## Boston Data Review
